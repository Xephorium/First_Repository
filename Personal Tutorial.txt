  GitHub is a platform for collaboration on programming projects. Intimidating
lingo and functions aside, it's simply a tool by which teams can work together
to create software without the fear of accidentally overriding or destroying
valuable code.

Notes
  - Git: Change-tracking client software on which GitHub is built
  - Repository (Repo): The basic unit of GitHub. A collection of
                       any files and folders that are neccesary for
                       a project. Usually contains a README.txt.
  - Branch: A duplicate of a repository used to add features or change
            code without breaking the 'master' (default) branch. Once
            the appropriate changes have been made to a branch, it can
            be pulled into the master to update the project.
  - Commits: Saved changes to the branch of a repository. When commented
             properly, commits read like a change history of a project.

//   Collaboration Models   //
//////////////////////////////

/*--- Fork & Pull ---*/

  "The fork & pull model lets anyone fork an existing repository and push changes
to their personal fork without requiring access be granted to the source repository.
The changes must then be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer."(1)

  Therefore, forking a project is basically creating a personal copy of that project
to which we can push whatever changes we want. However, if the changes are to be integrated
to the source, a pull request needs to be created by the forker and verified by source
project maintainer.

/*--- Shared Repository ---*/

  Usually reserved for small teams and private projects, this model grants everyone push
access to the same repository. Topic branches are used to isolate changes.
